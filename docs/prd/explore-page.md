# Explore Page - Product Requirements Document

## Vision Statement

The Explore tab enables users to discover and **join** tracks created by the global Project Vista community. It focuses on **community participation** - doing things together with others rather than managing personal content collections. Users join public tracks to participate alongside fellow community members, fostering motivation through shared experiences and social accountability.

## Core Mental Model Shift

**From:** "I'm collecting tracks to my personal library"
**To:** "I'm joining communities of people doing the same things"

This creates a socially motivated experience where users participate WITH others rather than managing individual content.

## Core User Experience

- **Real-time participation indicators**: "47 people currently on this track"
