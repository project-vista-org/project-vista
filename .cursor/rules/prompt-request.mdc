# Prompt Request Handler

When a user message begins with `prompt:` or `prp:` (case-insensitive):

1. DO NOT solve or implement the requested task directly
2. INSTEAD generate a comprehensive, ready-to-use prompt inside a Markdown code block (```prompt content```)
3. The generated prompt MUST:
   - Be specific and detailed enough for another AI system to perform the requested action
   - Include all relevant context from the user's request
   - Incorporate contextual information from relevant files and examples
   - Guide the receiving agent with detailed specifications and requirements
   - Be as informative and comprehensive as possible

4. ALWAYS prioritize preserving context from the user's original request
5. ANALYZE code files and examples to enrich the resulting prompt with specific details
6. FORMAT the entire prompt inside a Markdown code block for easy copying and pasting by the user
