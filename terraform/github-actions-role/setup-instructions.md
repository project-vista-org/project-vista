# Setting Up the GitHub Actions Role

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the GitHub Actions role for AWS authentication.

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI installed and configured with admin access
- Terraform installed on your local machine
- Git repository cloned locally

## Step 1: Configure AWS CLI

Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with admin credentials:

```bash
aws configure
# Enter your AWS Access Key ID
# Enter your AWS Secret Access Key
# Enter default region (e.g., eu-north-1)
# Enter default output format (e.g., json)
```

## Step 2: Update Variables (if needed)

The `variables.tf` file has been updated with the correct GitHub owner and repository name:
- GitHub owner: `the-vista-project`
- GitHub repo: `the-vista-project`

If you need to update the email for budget notifications, edit `terraform/github-actions-role/variables.tf`.

## Step 3: Deploy the GitHub Actions Role

Run the following commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the github-actions-role directory
cd terraform/github-actions-role

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Preview the changes
terraform plan

# Apply the changes
terraform apply
```

When prompted, type `yes` to confirm the deployment.

## Step 4: Note the Role ARN

After successful deployment, Terraform will output the GitHub Actions role ARN. It will look something like:
```
github_actions_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/project-vista-github-actions-role"
```

Copy this ARN for the next step.

## Step 5: Add the Role ARN to GitHub Repository Variables

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/the-vista-project/the-vista-project
2. Click on "Settings" (top navigation)
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Select the "Variables" tab
5. Click "New repository variable"
6. Add a variable:
   - Name: `AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME`
   - Value: [paste the role ARN from Step 4]
7. Click "Add variable"

## Step 6: Verify Setup

To verify the setup:
1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. Run the "Deploy Backend" workflow manually
3. Check that the workflow can successfully authenticate with AWS

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. **Trust Relationship Issues**:
   - Verify the trust relationship in the IAM role matches your GitHub repository exactly
   - Check the AWS CloudTrail logs for AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity failures

2. **Permission Issues**:
   - Ensure the role has the necessary permissions for the actions it needs to perform
   - Check the IAM policies attached to the role

3. **GitHub Workflow Issues**:
   - Verify the workflow has the correct permissions:
     ```yaml
     permissions:
       id-token: write
       contents: read
     ```
   - Ensure the variable `AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME` is correctly set in the repository
